This is a short, basic project about commiting HTML and CSS to Github.

I used flexbox to place all three recipe containers, and also used flexbox in order to vertically align each individual recipe page.

Although I could have used a grid layout for a more straightforward approach (specially in the responsive aspect), I decided to use flexbox only.
